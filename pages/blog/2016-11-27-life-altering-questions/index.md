Questions can be very powerful.  They have the ability to alter our lives
permanently.  The right question can get you out of a rut or on the path to a
much more fulfilling life.

I've noticed the quality of my life, relationships, and interactions are very
closely aligned with the quality of questions I'm asking myself and others.  I
decided to document some of these questions so I can refer back to them in the
future.  Hopefully others will also find them useful.

## Personal Questions

* What is my current major definite purpose?
* What should I be doing more of? Less of?
* Who should I be reaching out to in order to make progress towards my goals?
* When was the last time I reached out to family and loved ones?
* When was the last time I put myself in an uncomfortable position?
* Am I letting fear hold me back from anything?
* What am I 100% committed to accomplishing this week?

## Questions For Others
As an [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) I find small talk
and gossip to be incredibly annoying.  Don't get me wrong I enjoy talking to
people (well most people) but I find it much more fulfilling when conversations
can be about "deeper" topics.  Here are some questions that I've found that help lead
to deeper, more meaningful conversations.

* What was the happiest day in your life?
* What was the saddest day in your life?
* What place has most inspired you?
* What made you fall in love with your significant other?
* What work are you most passionate about?
* What do you wish your younger self had known about that you know today?
* If you hadn't gone into (insert profession) field, what do you think you would have done instead?
* Do you think you're introverted or extroverted?  Why do you think that?
* What are the most important things you'd like to accomplish this year?
* What is a common misconception people have about you?
* If married, what is the secret to your marriage?  What advice would you give someone my age who wants to get married one day?

## Stoic Questions

* What is the best way to live?
* What do I do about my anger?
* What are my obligations to my fellow human beings?
* I'm afraid to die; why is that?
* How can I deal with the difficult situations I face?
* How should I handle the success or power I hold?
